### OTU_bacterial_fungal_pre_processing.R
Code for the pre processing and assessment of microbial communities post bioinformatic processing detailed in the Bioinformatic_code directory of this repository. The files are not provided for this processing due the inclusion of samples that are not published. Please contact [Lukas Bell-Dereske]{www.ecobelldereske.com} for the raw data or find the raw sequences in the NCBI Short Read Archive under BioProject PRJNA733764 for bacterial communities and PRJNA799201 for fungal communities.

This code was used to produce 
+ Tables S3-S5
